CERTAINTY_ASSESSMENT := {Size=1:1}
[0|1|2|3]
The QUAY tag's value conveys the submitter's quantitative evaluation of the credibility of a piece of information, based upon its supporting evidence. Some systems use this feature to rank multiple conflicting opinions for display of most likely information first. It is not intended to eliminate the receiver's need to evaluate the evidence for themselves.

[ANSEL|UNICODE|ASCII]
A code value that represents the character set to be used to interpret this data. The default character set is ANSEL, which includes ASCII as a subset. UNICODE is not widely supported by most operating systems; therefore, GEDCOM produced using the UNICODE character set will be limited in acceptance for some time. See Chapter 3. ASCII contains the character set from 0x0 to 0x7F.

Note:The IBMPC character set is not allowed. This character set cannot be interpreted properly without knowing which code page the sender was using.

CHARACTER_SET_551 := {Size=1:8}
[ANSEL|UNICODE|ASCII|UTF-8]
A code value that represents the character set to be used to interpret this data. The default character set is ANSEL, which includes ASCII as a subset. UNICODE is not widely supported by most operating systems; therefore, GEDCOM produced using the UNICODE character set will be limited in acceptance for some time. See Chapter 3.

DATE := {Size=3:40}
[<DATE_CALENDAR_ESCAPE>|Null] <DATE_CALENDAR>

DATE_APPROXIMATED := {Size=4:40}
[ABT Whitespace <DATE>|CAL Whitespace <DATE>|EST Whitespace <DATE>]
Where :
ABT =About, meaning the date is not exact.
CAL =Calculated mathematically, for example, from an event date and age.
EST =Estimated based on an algorithm using some other event date.

DATE_CALENDAR := {Size=3:40}
[<DATE_GREG>|<DATE_JULN_ERA>|<DATE_HEBR>|<DATE_FREN>]

The selection is based on the <DATE_CALENDAR_ESCAPE> that precedes the <DATE_CALENDAR> value immediately to the left. If <DATE_CALENDAR_ESCAPE> doesn't appear at this point, then @#DGREGORIAN@ is assumed. No future calendar types will use words (e.g., month names) from this list: FROM, TO, BEF, AFT, BET, AND, ABT, EST, CAL, or INT. When only a day and month appears as a DATE value it is considered a date phrase and not a valid date form.
  Date Escape    Syntax Selected
  -----------    -------------
  @#DGREGORIAN@  <DATE_GREG>
  @#DJULIAN@     <DATE_JULN>
  @#DHEBREW@     <DATE_HEBR>
  @#DFRENCH R@   <DATE_FREN>
  @#DROMAN@      for future definition

DATE_CALENDAR_ESCAPE := {Size=4:15}
[@#DHEBREW@|@#DROMAN@|@#DFRENCH R@|@#DGREGORIAN@|@#DJULIAN@|@#DUNKNOWN@]
The date escape determines the date interpretation by signifying which <DATE_CALENDAR> to use. The default calendar is the Gregorian calendar.

DATE_JULN_ERA := {Size=4:40}
<DATE_JULN> [Whitespace|Null] [B.C.|Null]

DATE_LDS_ORD := {Size=4:40}
<DATE_VALUE>
LDS ordinance dates use only the Gregorian date and most often use the form of day, month, and year. Only in rare instances is there a partial date. The temple tag and code should always accompany temple ordinance dates. Sometimes the LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS is used to indicate that an ordinance date and temple code is not required, such as when BIC is used. (See LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS definitions.)

DATE_PERIOD := {Size=7:40}
[FROM Whitespace <DATE> Whitespace TO Whitespace <DATE>|FROM Whitespace <DATE>|TO Whitespace <DATE>]
Where:DATE>
FROM =Indicates the beginning of a happening or state.
TO =Indicates the ending of a happening or state.

Examples:
FROM 1904 to 1915
=The state of some attribute existed from 1904 to 1915 inclusive.
FROM 1904
=The state of the attribute began in 1904 but the end date is unknown.
TO 1915
=The state ended in 1915 but the begin date is unknown.

DATE_PHRASE := {Size=1:40}
StringInBrackets
Any statement offered as a date when the year is not recognizable to a date parser, but which gives information about when an event occurred. The date phrase is enclosed in matching parentheses.

DATE_RANGE := {Size=7:40}
[BEF Whitespace <DATE>|AFT Whitespace <DATE>|BET Whitespace <DATE> Whitespace AND Whitespace <DATE>]

Where :
AFT =Event happened after the given date.
BEF =Event happened before the given date.
BET =Event happened some time between date 1 AND date 2. For example, bet 1904 and 1915 indicates that the event state (perhaps a single day) existed somewhere between 1904 and 1915 inclusive.

The date range differs from the date period in that the date range is an estimate that an event happened on a single date somewhere in the date range specified.

The following are equivalent and interchangeable:
  Short form  Long Form
  ----------  ---------
  1852        BET 1 JAN 1852 AND 31 DEC 1852
  1852        BET 1 JAN 1852 AND DEC 1852
  1852        BET JAN 1852 AND 31 DEC 1852
  1852        BET JAN 1852 AND DEC 1852
  JAN 1920    BET 1 JAN 1920 AND 31 JAN 1920

DATE_VALUE := {Size=1:40}
DateValue
[<DATE>|<DATE_PERIOD>|<DATE_RANGE>|<DATE_APPROXIMATED>|INT Whitespace <DATE> Whitespace ( <DATE_PHRASE> )|( <DATE_PHRASE> )]

The DATE_VALUE represents the date of an activity, attribute, or event where:
INT =Interpreted from knowledge about the associated date phrase included in parentheses.

An acceptable alternative to the date phrase choice is to use one of the other choices such as <DATE_APPROXIMATED> choice as the DATE line value and then include the <DATE_PHRASE> as a NOTE value subordinate to the DATE line.

The date value can take on the date form of just a date, an approximated date, between a date and another date, and from one date to another date. The preferred form of showing date imprecision, is to show, for example, MAY 1890 rather than ABT 12 MAY 1890. This is because limits have not been assigned to the precision of the prefixes such as ABT or EST.

DAY := {Size=1:2}
Decimal
Day of the month, where dd is a numeric digit whose value is within the valid range of the days for the associated calendar month.

DESCRIPTIVE_TITLE := {Size=1:248}

ENCODED_MULTIMEDIA_LINE := {Size=1:87}
String
A line from a multimedia object which has been ENCODED. Each 54 characters of the multimedia object is encoded and stored in a 72 byte value. The encoding algorithm is used to convert binary objects into legal ASCII values which can be transmitted. See the encoding and decoding algorithms that are defined in Appendix E.

ENTRY_RECORDING_DATE := {Size=1:90}
<DATE_VALUE>

EVENT_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE := {Size=1:15}
[<EVENT_TYPE_INDIVIDUAL>|<EVENT_TYPE_FAMILY>|<ATTRIBUTE_TYPE>]
A code that classifies the principal event or happening that caused the source record entry to be created. If the event or attribute doesn't translate to one of these tag codes, then a user supplied code is expected, but will be considered as the generic tag EVEN for source certainty evaluation.

EVENT_DESCRIPTOR := {Size=1:90}
String
A descriptor that should be used whenever the EVEN tag is used to define the event being cited. For example, if the event was a purchase of a residence, the EVEN tag would be followed by a subordinate TYPE tag with the value "Purchased Residence." Using this descriptor with any of the other defined event tags basically classifies the basic definition of the associated tag but does not change its basic process. The form of using the TYPE tag with defined event tags has not been used by very many products. The MARR tag could be subordinated with a TYPE tag and EVENT_DESCRIPTOR value of Common Law. Other possible descriptor values might include "Childbirth%unmarried," "Common Law," or "Tribal Custom," for example. The event descriptor should use the same word or phrase and in the same language, when possible, as was used by the recorder of the event. Systems that display data from the GEDCOM form should be able to display the descriptor value in their screen or printed output.

EVENT_TYPE_CITED_FROM := {Size=1:15}
String
A code that indicates the type of event which was responsible for the source entry being recorded. For example, if the entry was created to record a birth of a child, then the type would be BIRT regardless of the assertions made from that record, such as the mother's name or mother's birth date. This will allow a prioritized best view choice and a determination of the certainty associated with the source used in asserting the cited fact.

EVENT_TYPE_FAMILY := {Size=3:4}
[ANUL|CENS|DIV|DIVF|ENGA|MARR|MARB|MARC|MARL|MARS|EVEN]

A code used to indicate the type of family event. The definition is the same as the corresponding event tag defined in Appendix A.

EVENTS_RECORDED := {Size=1:90}
[<EVENT_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE> , [Whitespace|Null] <EVENTS_RECORDED>|<EVENT_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE>]
An enumeration of the different kinds of events that were recorded in a particular source. Each enumeration is separated by a comma. Such as a parish register of births, deaths, and marriages would be BIRT, DEAT, MARR.

FILE_NAME := {Size=1:90}

GEDCOM_FORM := {Size=14:20}
[LINEAGE-LINKED]
The GEDCOM form used to construct this transmission. There maybe other forms used such as CommSoft's "EVENT_LINEAGE_LINKED" but these specifications define only the LINEAGE-LINKED Form. Systems will use this value to specify GEDCOM compatible with these specifications.

GENERATIONS_OF_ANCESTORS := {Size=1:4}
String
The number of generations of ancestors included in this transmission. This value is usually provided when FamilySearch programs build a GEDCOM file for a patron requesting a download of ancestors.

GENERATIONS_OF_DESCENDANTS := {Size=1:4}
String
The number of generations of descendants included in this transmission. This value is usually provided when FamilySearch programs build a GEDCOM file for a patron requesting a download of descendants.

PERMANENT_RECORD_FILE_NUMBER := {Size=1:90}
String
The record number that uniquely identifies this record within a registered network resource. The number will be usable as a cross-reference pointer. The use of the colon (:) is reserved to indicate the separation of the "registered resource identifier" (which precedes the colon) and the unique "record identifier" within that resource (which follows the colon). If the colon is used, implementations that check pointers should not expect to find a matching cross-reference identifier in the transmission but would find it in the indicated database within a network. Making resource files available to a public network is a future implementation.

String
This shows the jurisdictional entities that are named in a sequence from the lowest to the highest jurisdiction. The jurisdictions are separated by commas, and any jurisdiction's name that is missing is still accounted for by a comma. When a PLAC.FORM structure is included in the HEADER of a GEDCOM transmission, it implies that all place names follow this jurisdictional format and each jurisdiction is accounted for by a comma, whether the name is known or not. When the PLAC.FORM is subordinate to an event, it temporarily overrides the implications made by the PLAC.FORM structure stated in the HEADER. This usage is not common and, therefore, not encouraged. It should only be used when a system has over-structured its place-names.

PLACE_LATITUDE := {Size=1:30}
String
The value specifying the latitudinal coordinate of the place name. The latitude coordinate is the
direction North or South from the equator in degrees and fraction of degrees carried out to give the

N18.150944.  Minutes and seconds are converted by dividing the minutes value by 60 and the seconds
value by 3600 and adding the results together. This sum becomes the fractional part of the degree?s
value.

PLACE_LONGITUDE := {Size=1:30}
String
The value specifying the longitudinal coordinate of the place name. The longitude coordinate is
Degrees and fraction of degrees east or west of the zero or base meridian coordinate. For example:

PLACE_VALUE_STRING := {Size=1:120}
String
[<TEXT>|<TEXT> , Whitespace <PLACE_VALUE>]
The jurisdictional name of the place where the event took place. Jurisdictions are separated by commas, for example, "Cove, Cache, Utah, USA."

          2 TYPE FAM   /* ASSOCIATION is with a FAM record.
          2 RELA Witness at marriage

confidential will be treated differently, for example, there might be an option that
would stop confidential data from appearing on printed reports or would prevent that
information from being exported.

locked =Some records in Ancestral File have been satisfactorily proven by evidence, but because of source conflicts or incorrect traditions, there are repeated attempts to change this record. By arrangement, the Ancestral File Custodian can lock a record so that it cannot be changed without an agreement from the person assigned as the steward of such a record. The assigned steward is either the submitter listed for the record or Family History Support when no submitter is listed.

privacy =Information concerning this record is not present due to rights of or an approved request for privacy.

ROLE_DESCRIPTOR := {Size=1:25}

The method of delimiting a pointer or cross-reference identifier is to enclose the pointer or cross-reference identifier within at signs (@), for example, @I123@. A XREF may not begin with a number sign (#). This is to avoid confusion with an escape sequence prefix (@#). The use of a colon (:) in the XREF is reserved for creating future network cross-references and the use of an exclamation (!) is reserved for intra-record pointers. Uniqueness of the cross-reference identifier is required within the transmission file.
